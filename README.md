# Integrated Vehicle Management System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Integrated Vehicle Management System. This project aims to demonstrate your understanding and application of advanced C++ concepts such as data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, and more. The system manages different types of vehicles and supports various service stations, utilizing polymorphic behavior and complex interactions.

## Features
- **Base Class**: Vehicle, including common attributes like VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), make, model, and year.
- **Derived Classes**: Car, Truck, Motorcycle, each adding its own attributes and behaviors.
- **Service Stations**: ServiceStation, managing a queue of services and using polymorphism to handle all types of vehicles.
- **Advanced C++ Concepts**:
  - Static and dynamic members
  - Friend functions
  - Inline functions
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Namespaces and memory management

## Technologies

- **C++**: a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
